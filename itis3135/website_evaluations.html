                    Bad HTML is a website specifically designed to showcase bad web design principles. 
                    It provides articles that explain basic
                    web design principles, including HTML, CSS, file management, and SEO.

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="strong">Contrast:</span> Coloring is random and some text elements lack sufficent contrast 
                    against their backgrounds. There are also many floating particles, that obscure text, with no meaning.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Repetition:</span> Site uses a custom cursor, however on clickable elements, the
                        cursor switches back to default which is not consistent with custom cursor style. Otherwise, styles 
                        are consistent from page to page. </li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Alignment:</span> Many elements seem cluttered, detracting from the sites coherence.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Proximity:</span> Information about completely different topics, ex. weather chart, clock
                    , and jokes, are grouped together, leading to confusion about related content.</li>

                    Headings and following text are consistent.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Alignment:</span> Text is left-aligned under submitted websites and courses, resulting 
                    in a cohesive and predictable web layout.</li>
                    <li><span class="strong">Proximity:</span> Website sections are properly spaced and related content is grouped
                    together, allowing for text to be clear and understandable.</li>
